# Hi, I'm Chris!

I enjoy prototyping new data systems analysis solutions using tools like Django (Python), D3.js (javascript) and Jupyter Notebook.
My background in simulation and system administration with a recent qualification in business systems analysis has provided a firm foundation for adventures in [academia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BdSaJPUAAAAJ&hl=en) and data consulting.
