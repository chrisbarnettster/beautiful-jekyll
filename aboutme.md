# Hi, I'm Chris Barnett!

I enjoy prototyping new data systems analysis solutions using tools like Django (Python), D3.js (javascript) and Jupyter Notebook.
My background in simulation and system administration with a recent qualification in business systems analysis has provided a firm foundation for adventures in academia and data consulting.

Something missing or would you like know more about how my skills could be of value?
